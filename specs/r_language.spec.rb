    # to an R symbol.  The formula '+:a =~ +:b', can also be written as '+:a =~ :b'.  Be
    # careful, however, when using the Ruby symbol without the '+' since in a more complex
    # formula, Ruby's precedence rules might not result in what is expected.  As an example
    # '+:a =~ :b * +:c' crashes with the error 'b' not found, since '*' has precedence over
    # '=~' and this is equivalent to '+:a =~ (:b * +:c)' and there is no sense in
    # multiplying a Ruby symbol. The recomendation is to always use the '+' function
    # before the Ruby symbol.
