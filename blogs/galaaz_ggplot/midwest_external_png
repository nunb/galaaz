    Sir Galahad (/ˈɡæləhæd/; sometimes referred to as Galeas /ɡəˈliːəs/ or Galath /ˈɡæləθ/),
    in Arthurian legend, is a knight of King Arthur's Round Table and one of the three
    achievers of the Holy Grail. He is the illegitimate son of Sir Lancelot and Elaine of
    Corbenic, and is renowned for his gallantry and purity as the most perfect of all knights.
    Emerging quite late in the medieval Arthurian tradition, Sir Galahad first appears in the
    Lancelot–Grail cycle, and his story is taken up in later works such as the Post-Vulgate
    Cycle and Sir Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur. His name should not be mistaken with
    Galehaut, a different knight from Arthurian legend.
